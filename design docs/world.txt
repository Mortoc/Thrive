The world of thrive is an extrapolation of our current technologies in an optimistic future. The main assumptions are: that humans can overcome climate change without a catastrophic meltdown; that the singularity doesn't happen as soon as some people alive today expect; and that war isn't abolished but as a species we are able to reduce the amount of war and terrorism over time.

Timeline
	2013 - Current Day, average of 5 people live in orbit

	2020s - Private space travel begins to open up. Private corporations begin to successfully mine raw materials from asteroids and orbital construction becomes an industry. Economic pressures create opportunity to increase NASA funding. Research in nuclear rockets for use in interplanetary missions becomes legal. 2nd golden age of space travel begins.
	2020s - 100 people live in Earth orbit.
	2025 - Many rare earth metals are discovered in the asteroid belt. Gold and Uranium supplies increase drastically. It is now common to drop asteroids from orbit to earth for mining.
	2027 - Drilling robot finds life on Europa.
	2027 - Breakthrough in ion-antimatter drive technology drastically reduces fuel weight on ships.

	2030s - Superstorms and flooding increases. New construction industries opening up to "shore up" cities. 1st world cities begin to become resistant to the effects of global climate change. 3rd world cities suffer.
	2030s - Age inoculation begins. Average life expectancy among the rich exceeds 150.
	2030s - 1,000 people live in Earth orbit and beyond.
	2030s - India, EU and China now match the US as world superpowers.
	2030s - Neuron-fidelity brain scans possible.
	2032 - International team reaches Mars. It is a one-way trip. Mars colony founded.
	2034 - 2nd Mars mission expands colony. Evidence of ancient martian bacteria discovered.
	2037 - Mars launch capability added, now 50 people live on Mars.

	2040s - 10,000 people live off of Earth.
	2040s - Many previous-generation 3rd world countries are now stabilized and starting to become prosperous. Decentralized global economy boom. 
	2040s - Age inoculation now commonplace. Average life expectancy for all humans reaches 175 years.
	2040s - Mind-machine interfaces allow for extending of any of the external senses. Computers can be controlled with thought. Human brains can be backed up but not queried for information.
	2040s - Global warming still increasing. Superstorms now as commonplace as hurricanes.
	2040s - Chinese economic collapse triggers a reduced role as a superpower.
	2040s - Scientific breakthrough: Stable quantum paring over a distance of nearly 1AU. Internet expands to entire solar system.
	2042 - First functional warp drive tested. Mankind hasn't broken the light-speed barrier yet, but now has technology that could.
	2043 - Robotic missions to all planets commonplace.
	2045 - First man to travel faster than light.
	2049 - First robotic mission to extrasolar system conducted. Alpha centauri mapped - 3 planets discovered that do not support life.

	2050s - Nearly all counties are now part of Unions. Europe contains Russia and much of Africa. Middle east, Egypt, China, and Indonesia are part of the Indian Union. South Korea, Japan, The Americas, and Australia are now part of the American Union. America finally gives up and adopts the metric system.
	2050s - 1,000,000 people live off of Earth. Overcrowding on planet due to increased life expectancy.
	2050s - Terraforming technology begins to take off. Mars now has an agricultural economy forming (people still can't live outside but bioengineered crops can).

	2060s - Education has mostly replaced extremism, The three world-power system seems to be very stable, large scale war now very unlikely. Israel (part of the EU) is still fighting with much of the middle-east (now a part of the IU)
	2060s - Terraforming has begun to stabilize global warming and reduce the chances of superstorms.

	2070s - 25% of Earth's population lives off of the planet. Hollowed out asteroids in orbit of Earth and Moon begin to be home to new space-faring generations.
	2075 - First robotic mission to an exoplanet finds botanical life. Planet named Athenia. 34 other planets exist in the Athenian system, many could contain life. Much larger asteroid belt in this system.

	2084 - Player character born in Earth orbit.

	2090s - 50% of people live off of Earth. Less than 1% of people now die of old age.
	2090s - The Gamaetheon, the first arkship, made from a hollowed out asteroid, reaches Athenia. 250,000 people now live in orbit of an exoplanet. The journey between Athenia and Earth takes approximately 6 months. During the journey, Gamaetheon leaves quantum locked relays for instantaneous communication between Earth and Athenia.

	2100s - Gamaetheon laws enforcing strict 1:1 reproduction are relaxed, men and women no longer sterilized after 2 children. population begins to grow.
	2103 - Player character enters college on Gamaetheon.

	2110s - People no longer die of old age. Brain empty clones can be created and used as backup. Permanent death nearly nonexistent.
	2110s - Gamaetheon population now 330,000. Beginning to be overcrowded - settlements on Athenia begin.
	2110s - Botanical life on Athenia begins to change, humans begin to understand that it's not like plant life that evolved on Earth.
	2113 - Game Current Day.
